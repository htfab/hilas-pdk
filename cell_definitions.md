# Standard Cell Blocks: 
| Block Name            | size              | Description | 
| swc4x2cell            | 20.12um x 6.05um  | Core switch cell ,Varactor capacitor cell |
| swc4x2cellOverlap     | 17.97um x 6.05um  | Core switch cell,  Overlap capacitor based cell |
| TA2Cell_NoFG          | 17.92um x 6.05um  | Core transimpedance amplifier |
| TA2Cell_1FG           | 28.09um x 6.05um  | Core transimpedance amp; floating-gate inputs. (C4 block is a specific routing of this cell's terminals) |
| TA2Cell_1FG_Strong    | 28.10um x 6.05um  | Core transimpedance amp; strong FG inputs. |
| WTA4Stage01           | 14.07um x 6.05um  | Connects directly to array of swc4x2cell.  Can array vertically.  Needs one current source. |
| DAC5bit01             | ~14um   x 6.05um  | 5-bit digital-to-analog converter (under 6.05um at the moment; thinking through expansion to 6bit and 7bit, and they would use this cell). |
| SWC4x1BiasCell        | 11.05um x 6.05um  | 
| FG transistors        |                   | 2x1 bare FG transistors

#In progress:
 - larger DAC block
 - Capacitor block?
