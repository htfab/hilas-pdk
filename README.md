# Hilas Standard Cells
This repo contains a set of analog standard cells designed for the 
"Skywater 130nm" fabrication process available at the Google Skywater 
(formerly Cypress Semi.) foundry.

These cells can be used in the openLANE/openROAD toolchains in order
to create GDSII files for fabrication.

Here is a map:
