# Hilas Standard Cells
This repo contains a set of analog standard cells designed for the 
"Skywater 130nm" fabrication process available at the Google Skywater 
(formerly Cypress Semi.) foundry.

These cells can be used in the openLANE/openROAD toolchains in order
to create GDSII files for fabrication.

# PG (power/ground) and Interfacing
Vdd: normal supply 1.8V (analog 1.8V)
GND: reference 0
Vinj:  run time: 1.8V, prog: 1.8V â€“ 6.0V

# Standard Cell Blocks:
| Block Name            | size              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| swc4x2cell            | 20.12um x 6.05um  | Core switch cell ,Varactor capacitor cell |
| swc4x2cellOverlap     | 17.97um x 6.05um  | Core switch cell,  Overlap capacitor based cell |
| TA2Cell_NoFG          | 17.92um x 6.05um  | Core transimpedance amplifier |
| TA2Cell_1FG           | 28.09um x 6.05um  | Core transimpedance amp; floating-gate inputs. (C4 block is a specific routing of this cell's terminals) |
| TA2Cell_1FG_Strong    | 28.10um x 6.05um  | Core transimpedance amp; strong FG inputs. |
| WTA4Stage01           | 14.07um x 6.05um  | Connects directly to array of swc4x2cell.  Can array vertically.  Needs one current source. |
| DAC5bit01             | ~14um   x 6.05um  | 5-bit digital-to-analog converter (under 6.05um at the moment; thinking through expansion to 6bit and 7bit, and they would use this cell). |
| SWC4x1BiasCell        | 11.05um x 6.05um  |
| FG transistors        |                   | 2x1 bare FG transistors

#Cells In Progress:
| Block Name            | size              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| larger DAC block      |                   | A DAC with >5-bit resolution |
| Capacitor block       |                   | Programmable Capacitor |
